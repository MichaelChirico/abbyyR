#### Load the package

To get started, load the package. The latest version of the package will always be on github. Instructions for installing the package from github are provided below.

Get the latest version from github:

# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('soodoku/abbyyR')
"
```

#### Set credentials

Your first task on loading the package should be to set the credentials - application ID and password. If you haven't already, you can get this information 
[http://ocrsdk.com/](http://ocrsdk.com/). Once you have the application ID and password, set it via the `setapp` function. 


```r

#### Delete Task

Deleting an already deleted task will result in an error.

**Submit an Image for Processing**
